        <div class="subheading mb-5">UCR Biology Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a third year biology major at UCR. At UCR my classes focus on many areas of science like anatomy and physiology, chemistry and organic chemistry, biology and microbiology, physics, entomology, hormones and viruses and many more classes offered in the biological field. After completing my bachelors degree, I plan on getting a masters in Physician Assistant. This requires two more years of school with more science and biology related courses in addition to a lot of work experience.<br><br>

        I am currently a pediatric certified nursing assistant. I work with children who have disabilities. My responsibilities include performing the kids activities of daily living which includes taking care of the kids, sending them to school, taking them to doctor appointments, and performing their daily range of motion. A big part of my job is communicating with the kid’s parents and making sure they are as involved in the care as they wish to be. Other aspects of the job include working together as a team, getting work done in an efficient and timely manner, and staying organized with all the kid’s charts and appointments because there are a lot of kids with all different kinds of doctors appointments. <br><br>

        In my past, I have had other hospital care experiences. One of which includes volunteering at a rehabilitation facility in the occupational therapy department. During this work, I observed and helped the occupational and physical therapist with their daily appointments with patients that had been in accidents and were immobible. During this experience, I got to learn how to use many of the rehabilitative equipment like vibration machines and simpler ones like bouncy balls and even card games to help with therapy. This required being very engaging with the patients continuously because they were the main focus for the hour and then another one came back to back almost. I have also had other health care experience in the mother and baby unit at a hospital. The mother and baby unit was where new mothers who had just given birth to their kids would come for recovery. This was a unique experience because I had a chance to talk to a lot of new moms and this sometimes required providing them with a lot of emotional support because they would trust that you were taking good care of their newborn. During this volunteer experience, I was able to learn how to get work done efficiently and in a timely manner because I helped the nurses on the floor handle and take care of around 12 occupied rooms at a time. The duties for this job included keeping charts updated and organized, making new folders and pamphlets to help new moms with baby care instructions, set up each new room with the correct equipment, set up baby beds, ensure the safety of the floor because babies needed to be kept a watch on at all times, taking the moms to their designated places which could be to the nicu or in a wheelchair to their cars.
